# What is gpxsf?

Very simple package which converts GPX files to `sf` objects. 


```{r}
library(sf) ## for print methods of sf objects
gpx <- system.file("./gpx/city_trail.gpx", package = "gpxsf")
sf <- gpxsf::gpx_sf( gpx )

sf

```

And that's it.

However, the real benefit, and the reason I built this package, is so we can plot them in mapdeck's trip layer

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(mapdeck)

mapdeck() %>% 
  add_trips()

```
